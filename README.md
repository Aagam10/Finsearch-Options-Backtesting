Steps in this Script:
Black-Scholes Calculation: The function black_scholes_call calculates the theoretical price of a European call option.
Parameter Assumptions: Assumptions are made for the strike price (K), time to maturity (T), risk-free rate (r), and volatility (sigma). You need to adapt the code to include actual strike prices, maturities, and implied volatilities.
Error Calculation: The script calculates the error between the real and Black-Scholes prices using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Note :
Since there was no concrete dataset available for options data, I took a real time data and backtested my code on it.
